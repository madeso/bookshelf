 **To summarize **, designing good software takes about six steps:

1. Invent some users
2. Figure out the important activities
3. Figure out the *user model* - how the user will expect to accomplish those activities
4. Sketch out the first draft of the design
5. Iterate over your design again and again, making it easier and easier until it's well within the capabilities of your imaginary users
6. Watch real humans trying to use your software. Note the areas where people have trouble, which probably demonstrate areas where the program model isn't matching the user model.


Good UI sells software, but it also *makes people happy*, because people are happy when they accomplish the task they wanted to accomplish. Which is why UI design is such a satisfying field to be in. Where else are you going to get a chance to make millions of people just a little bit happier?
