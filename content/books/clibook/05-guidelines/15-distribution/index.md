**If possible, distribute as a single binary.**
If your language doesn’t compile to binary executables as standard, see if it has something like [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).
If you really can’t distribute as a single binary, use the platform’s native package installer so you aren’t scattering things on disk that can’t easily be removed.
Tread lightly on the user’s computer.

If you’re making a language-specific tool, such as a code linter, then this rule doesn’t apply—it’s safe to assume the user has an interpreter for that language installed on their computer.

**Make it easy to uninstall.**
If it needs instructions, put them at the bottom of the install instructions—one of the most common times people want to uninstall software is right after installing it.
