The purpose of [help text](#help) is to give a brief, immediate sense of what your tool is, what options are available, and how to perform the most common tasks.
Documentation, on the other hand, is where you go into full detail.
It’s where people go to understand what your tool is for, what it _isn’t_ for, how it works and how to do everything they might need to do.

**Provide web-based documentation.**
People need to be able to search online for your tool’s documentation, and to link other people to specific parts.
The web is the most inclusive documentation format available.

**Provide terminal-based documentation.**
Documentation in the terminal has several nice properties: it’s fast to access, it stays in sync with the specific installed version of the tool, and it works without an internet connection.

**Consider providing man pages.**
[man pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page), Unix’s original system of documentation, are still in use today, and many users will reflexively check `man mycmd` as a first step when trying to learn about your tool.
To make them easier to generate, you can use a tool like [ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn.1.html) (which can also generate your web docs).

However, not everyone knows about `man`, and it doesn’t run on all platforms, so you should also make sure your terminal docs are accessible via your tool itself.
For example, `git` and `npm` make their man pages accessible via the `help` subcommand, so `npm help ls` is equivalent to `man npm-ls`.
