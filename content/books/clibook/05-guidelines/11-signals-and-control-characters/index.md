**If a user hits Ctrl-C (the INT signal), exit as soon as possible.**
Say something immediately, before you start clean-up.
Add a timeout to any clean-up code so it can’t hang forever.

**If a user hits Ctrl-C during clean-up operations that might take a long time, skip them.**
Tell the user what will happen when they hit Ctrl-C again, in case it is a destructive action.

For example, when quitting Docker Compose, you can hit Ctrl-C a second time to force your containers to stop immediately instead of shutting them down gracefully.

```
$  docker-compose up
…
^CGracefully stopping... (press Ctrl+C again to force)
```

Your program should expect to be started in a situation where clean-up has not been run.
