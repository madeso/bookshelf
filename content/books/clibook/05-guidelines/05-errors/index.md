One of the most common reasons to consult documentation is to fix errors.
If you can make errors into documentation, then this will save the user loads of time.

**Catch errors and rewrite them for humans.**
If you’re expecting an error to happen, catch it and rewrite the error message to be useful.
Think of it like a conversation, where the user has done something wrong and the program is guiding them in the right direction.
Example: “Can’t write to file.txt. You might need to make it writable by running ‘chmod +w file.txt’.”

**Signal-to-noise ratio is crucial.**
The more irrelevant output you produce, the longer it’s going to take the user to figure out what they did wrong.
If your program produces multiple errors of the same type, consider grouping them under a single explanatory header instead of printing many similar-looking lines.

**Consider where the user will look first.**
Put the most important information at the end of the output.
The eye will be drawn to red text, so use it intentionally and sparingly.

**If there is an unexpected or unexplainable error, provide debug and traceback information, and instructions on how to submit a bug.**
That said, don’t forget about the signal-to-noise ratio: you don’t want to overwhelm the user with information they don’t understand.
Consider writing the debug log to a file instead of printing it to the terminal.

**Make it effortless to submit bug reports.**
One nice thing you can do is provide a URL and have it pre-populate as much information as possible.
