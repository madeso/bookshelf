**Only use prompts or interactive elements if `stdin` is an interactive terminal (a TTY).**
This is a pretty reliable way to tell whether you’re piping data into a command or whether it's being run in a script, in which case a prompt won’t work and you should throw an error telling the user what flag to pass.

**If `--no-input` is passed, don’t prompt or do anything interactive.**
This allows users an explicit way to disable all prompts in commands.
If the command requires input, fail and tell the user how to pass the information as a flag.

**If you’re prompting for a password, don’t print it as the user types.**
This is done by turning off echo in the terminal.
Your language should have helpers for this.

**Let the user escape.**
Make it clear how to get out.
(Don’t do what vim does.)
If your program hangs on network I/O etc, always make Ctrl-C still work.
If it’s a wrapper around program execution where Ctrl-C can’t quit (SSH, tmux, telnet, etc), make it clear how to do that.
For example, SSH allows escape sequences with the `~` escape character.
