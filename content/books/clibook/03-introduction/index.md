This document covers both high-level design philosophy, and concrete guidelines.
It’s heavier on the guidelines because our philosophy as practitioners is not to philosophize too much.
We believe in learning by example, so we’ve provided plenty of those.

This guide doesn’t cover full-screen terminal programs like emacs and vim.
Full-screen programs are niche projects—very few of us will ever be in the position to design one.

This guide is also agnostic about programming languages and tooling in general.

Who is this guide for?

-   If you are creating a CLI program and you are looking for principles and concrete best practices for its UI design, this guide is for you.
-   If you are a professional “CLI UI designer,” that’s amazing—we’d love to learn from you.
-   If you’d like to avoid obvious missteps of the variety that go against 40 years of CLI design conventions, this guide is for you.
-   If you want to delight people with your program’s good design and helpful help, this guide is definitely for you.
-   If you are creating a GUI program, this guide is not for you—though you may learn some GUI anti-patterns if you decide to read it anyway.
-   If you are designing an immersive, full-screen CLI port of Minecraft, this guide isn’t for you.
    (But we can’t wait to see it!)
